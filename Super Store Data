# 📊 Super Store Sales Analysis Process  

## Overview  
This process involves analyzing sales data from four sheets: `Sales`, `Customer`, `Description`, and `Group`. The objective is to ensure data integrity, extract key insights, and visualize trends using **Power BI**.  

## 🔧 Data Preparation Steps  
1. **Duplicate the dataset** to maintain the original data.  
2. **Add a Serial Number (S/N)** column for easy reference.  
3. **Handle missing data** by identifying and filling blank cells.  
4. **Correct spelling errors** and standardize values.  
5. **Find and replace values** where necessary.  
6. **Separate negative and positive values** using formulas.  
7. **Apply `VLOOKUP`** to merge relevant data into the `Customer` sheet.  

### Example: Using `VLOOKUP` in Excel  
```excel
=VLOOKUP(A2, Sales!A:D, 2, FALSE)
